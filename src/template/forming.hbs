                        Forming, metal forming, is the metalworking process of fashioning metal parts and objects
                        through mechanical deformation; the workpiece is reshaped without adding or removing material,
                        and its mass remains unchanged.[1] Forming operates on the materials science principle of
                        plastic deformation, where the physical shape of a material is permanently deformed.

                                        germplasm conservation of animals and plants. To protect genetic resources,
                                        repositories have been
                                        developed with national and international cooperation. For a repository to be
                                        effective, the genetic
                                        material submitted must be of good quality and comparable to other submissions.
                                        However, due to a
                                        variety of reasons, including constraints in knowledge and available resources,

                                        methods for aquatic species vary widely across user groups which reduces
                                        reproducibility and
                                        weakens quality control. We have developed a standardizable freezing device

                                        In general, as most plastics are cooled towards cryogenic temperatures, they
                                        become
                                        harder,
                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                        stretch
                                        prior to breaking)
                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus
                                        (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                        Depending on
                                        formulation,
                                        plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                        and
                                        will fail by
                                        snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                        can
                                        undergo
                                        considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                        flexible at LN2
                                        temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                        than
                                        undergoing
                                        irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                        environments. These traits
                                        enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                        that
                                        can be assembled
                                        in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                        category of
                                        apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                        Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                        CryoKit
                                        and Cajun Ejector.
                                        The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                        with
                                        LN2 in a
                                        standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                        thermocouples placed
                                        in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                        of
                                        4-40°C/min by
                                        adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing

                                        repositories have been
                                        developed with national and international cooperation. For a repository to be

                                        material submitted must be of good quality and comparable to other submissions.
                                        However, due to a

                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of

                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the

                                        In general, as most plastics are cooled towards cryogenic temperatures, they
                                        become
                                        harder,
                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                        stretch
                                        prior to breaking)
                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus
                                        (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                        Depending on
                                        formulation,
                                        plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                        and
                                        will fail by
                                        snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                        can
                                        undergo
                                        considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                        flexible at LN2
                                        temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                        than
                                        undergoing
                                        irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                        environments. These traits
                                        enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                        that
                                        can be assembled
                                        in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                        category of
                                        apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                        Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                        CryoKit
                                        and Cajun Ejector.
                                        The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                        with
                                        LN2 in a
                                        standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                        thermocouples placed
                                        in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                        of
                                        4-40°C/min by
                                        adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing
                                        the
                                        current
                                        prototype.

                                        In general, as most plastics are cooled towards cryogenic temperatures, they
                                        become
                                        harder,
                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                        stretch
                                        prior to breaking)
                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus
                                        (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                        Depending on
                                        formulation,
                                        plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                        and
                                        will fail by
                                        snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                        can
                                        undergo
                                        considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                        flexible at LN2
                                        temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                        than
                                        undergoing
                                        irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                        environments. These traits
                                        enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                        that
                                        can be assembled
                                        in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                        category of
                                        apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                        Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                        CryoKit
                                        and Cajun Ejector.
                                        The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                        with
                                        LN2 in a
                                        standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                        thermocouples placed
                                        in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                        of
                                        4-40°C/min by
                                        adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing

                                        repositories have been
                                        developed with national and international cooperation. For a repository to be
                                        effective, the genetic
                                        material submitted must be of good quality and comparable to other submissions.
                                        However, due to a
                                        variety of reasons, including constraints in knowledge and available resources,

                                        methods for aquatic species vary widely across user groups which reduces

                                        weakens quality control. We have developed a standardizable freezing device

                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of

                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus

                                        In general, as most plastics are cooled towards cryogenic temperatures, they
                                        become
                                        harder,
                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                        stretch
                                        prior to breaking)
                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus
                                        (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                        Depending on
                                        formulation,
                                        plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                        and
                                        will fail by
                                        snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                        can
                                        undergo
                                        considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                        flexible at LN2
                                        temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                        than
                                        undergoing
                                        irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                        environments. These traits
                                        enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                        that
                                        can be assembled
                                        in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                        category of
                                        apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                        Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                        CryoKit
                                        and Cajun Ejector.
                                        The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                        with
                                        LN2 in a
                                        standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                        thermocouples placed
                                        in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                        of
                                        4-40°C/min by
                                        adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing
                                        the
                                        current
                                        prototype.

                                    become
                                    harder,
                                    stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                    plastics following
                                    cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                    formulated for cryogenic
                                    applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                    stretch
                                    prior to breaking)
                                    as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                    the
                                    elastic modulus
                                    (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                    Depending on
                                    formulation,
                                    plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                    and
                                    will fail by
                                    snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                    can
                                    undergo
                                    considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                    flexible at LN2
                                    temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                    than
                                    undergoing
                                    irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                    environments. These traits
                                    enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                    that
                                    can be assembled
                                    in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                    category of
                                    apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                    Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                    CryoKit
                                    and Cajun Ejector.
                                    The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                    with
                                    LN2 in a
                                    standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                    thermocouples placed
                                    in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                    of
                                    4-40°C/min by
                                    adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing

                                        germplasm conservation of animals and plants. To protect genetic resources,
                                        repositories have been
                                        developed with national and international cooperation. For a repository to be
                                        effective, the genetic
                                        material submitted must be of good quality and comparable to other submissions.
                                        However, due to a
                                        variety of reasons, including constraints in knowledge and available resources,

                                        methods for aquatic species vary widely across user groups which reduces
                                        reproducibility and
                                        weakens quality control. We have developed a standardizable freezing device

                                        can be accessed globally, and we demonstrated that 3-D printers can be used to

                                        accepted tool for long-term
                                        germplasm conservation of animals and plants. To protect genetic resources,
                                        repositories have been
                                        developed with national and international cooperation. For a repository to be
                                        effective, the genetic
                                        material submitted must be of good quality and comparable to other submissions.
                                        However, due to a
                                        variety of reasons, including constraints in knowledge and available resources,
                                        cryopreservation
                                        methods for aquatic species vary widely across user groups which reduces
                                        reproducibility and
                                        weakens quality control. We have developed a standardizable freezing device
                                        produced
                                        using
                                        3-dimensional (3-D) printing and introduce the concept of network sharing to
                                        achieve
                                        aggregate
                                        high-throughput cryopreservation for aquatic species. Through this approach,
                                        identical components
                                        can be accessed globally, and we demonstrated that 3-D printers can be used to
                                        fabricate parts for
                                        standardizable freezing devices yielding relevant and reproducible cooling rates
                                        across users. With
                                        standardized devices for freezing, methods and samples can harmonize into an
                                        aggregated
                                        high-throughput pathway not currently available for aquatic species repository

                                        In general, as most plastics are cooled towards cryogenic temperatures, they
                                        become
                                        harder,
                                        stiffer, and more brittle to mechanical loads, as evidenced by shattering of
                                        plastics following
                                        cooling with liquid nitrogen (LN2). Except for a few polymers specifically
                                        formulated for cryogenic
                                        applications, plastics exhibit a decrease in tensile elongation (degree of
                                        stretch
                                        prior to breaking)
                                        as temperature decreases. Also as plastics are cooled there is an increase in
                                        the
                                        elastic modulus
                                        (ratio of elongation per applied stress, often described as stiffness).
                                        Depending on
                                        formulation,
                                        plastics will undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition at some point below 0°C,
                                        and
                                        will fail by
                                        snapping rather than deforming. In our experience, objects 3-D printed with PLA
                                        can
                                        undergo
                                        considerable elongation prior to breaking, with spring-like designs remaining
                                        flexible at LN2
                                        temperatures. Even when cooled, these objects display elastic behavior rather
                                        than
                                        undergoing
                                        irreversible plastic deformation, making them useful in low-temperature
                                        environments. These traits
                                        enable printing of multi-component devices with flat platforms to hold samples
                                        that
                                        can be assembled
                                        in multiple configurations to provide a range of cooling rates. We refer to this
                                        category of
                                        apparatus as a Positional Platform Cooling Device (PCPD).

                                        Two prototypes of PCPD devices have been developed and tested, naming the
                                        CryoKit
                                        and Cajun Ejector.
                                        The CryoKit (Fig. 1) was developed to freeze samples in French straws or vials
                                        with
                                        LN2 in a
                                        standardized polystyrene cooler. Preliminary temperature measurements from
                                        thermocouples placed
                                        in straws indicate that reproducible cooling rates can be achieved in the range
                                        of
                                        4-40°C/min by
                                        adjusting the configuration and height above the LN2. We are actively optimizing
                                        the
                                        current
                                        prototype.
